WORK IN PROGRESS

A hand-crafted compiler for the C (C1X) programming language.

What has been done ?

* The processor can scan C files and produce a stream of tokens,
* Generate LR(0) parsing automata for grammars.

The parser generator also generates dot files that can be visualized using an online Graphviz viewer. Check the Wiki for details and progress.
